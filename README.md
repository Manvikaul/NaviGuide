# NAVIGUIDE
An indoor navigation android application which guides the user to his/her destination via pointers in augmented environment.
The application makes use of Unity's Navmesh algorithm to find the shortest path to the required destination and this path is rendered in real time in augmented environment by the use of arrow pointers. The user is directed to his/her destination through AR arrows and voice signals. <br>
