# NAVIGUIDE

The global positioning system (GPS) has significantly impacted our lives by thoroughly simplifying the problem of navigation and location finding. However, the same system fails when implemented inside a building. The signals from the satellites get scattered and are attenuated by the building walls, roofs and other objects present inside it. Besides this, the results produced by a GPS device indoor may sometimes produce errors that are larger than the total indoor space itself.

Considering the problems/shortcomings in the existing indoor positioning systems, we aim to provide a system called "NaviGuide: A 3D Indoor Navigation System" which is intended to provide the user's with a real-time indoor positioning system in a 3D Augmented Reality Environment. This indoor navigation system combines the features of a GPS system with precision by making use of sensory information from automated devices. The system deals with navigation within the building, by precisely locating an individual within the building and guiding him/her through the building to their desired destination by making use of optimal paths. The optimal path so detected is formulated with the help of an optimization algorithm. This optimal path detected is rendered in an augmented environment which helps to guide the user through the path with the help of 3D arrows. All the user has to do is scan a QR code and select his/her desired destination. The application takes care of the rest.
